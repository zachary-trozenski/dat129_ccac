# Webscraping project
## Details
I'm using [IMDB's Top 250 film list](https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/?ref_=nv_mv_250)

## Research question:
The 1970's is often lauded as producing some of the most critically
acclaimed films in cinematic history. However, how many of IMDB's Top
250 films are actually from the 70's and what is the proportion of the whole?
If not the seventies, then which decade is the most "critically acclaimed"?

## Additional output:
Proportions each decade in percentages, in ascending order from 1920's to 2010's
