## About me
My name is Zach and I'm a linguist by trade. I'm learning how to become more adept at coding with a focus on Python. I'm inspired by all the hockey data analytics nerds fighting the good fight and producing incredible information. I like watching hockey, cooking, camping, bird watching, and annoying my wife and cats (in that order).
