## Challenge
Try writing a function using recursion that mimics the behavior of the Fibonacci sequence so that if you give pass the function a number indicating the position, the function will return the positional value.

For example, if I pass the function "8" the output would be "13"/ 

The Fibonacci sequence is which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers starting from 0 and 1.

It looks like this:
* 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ...

For reference, here's a [link to the Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) for some background.
