# Capital Project Filter script

## How to use the script

* The capital projects csv is included and should be run from the same directory as the python script
* Open the sort criteria json file and edit each of the fields to pull the data you would like
* Fields available are: fiscal year, status, area, start date, and asset type
* Be sure to format the values the same in the json as they are written in the csv
* The output will be a plain text file with the relevant project ids that met your filter criteria (new line separated)
